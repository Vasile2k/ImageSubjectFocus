# ImageSubjectFocus

A little application meant to detect main subject of an image and add depth and focus fx on it.

It's tested on Windows but it should run on Linux too.

Only for x64. Why? Because why not...

## Prerequisities

 * Sometin' able to compile C++17
 * Visual Studio may help but it's not necessary

## Installation

`git clone` this somewhere you like.

Open the project in Visual Studion(2019 or newer) or build it with your favorite compiler.

## Usage
